## Full-stack application: [Best Advice I Ever Got](https://best-worst-advice.herokuapp.com/)

### Objective
Create a site where visitors can post the best advice they've ever gotten and who gave it to them. Users can also read and comment on entries from other users. The administrator can edit and delete entries and comments.

### Technologies Used
* Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux + Thunk, Axios
* Back End: Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
* Hosted at Heroku with the database at MLab

### Challenges / Lessons Learned
* (In progress)

### Ideas for improvements
* User authentication so users can edit / delete their own entries.


## Front-end application: [Movie Game](https://movie-game.netlify.com/)
[View the code on Github](https://github.com/vnsn/assignments/tree/master/projects/d30-01-api-project)

### Objective
Game where users are shown a movie title and the names of 4 actors. They have to guess which actor was NOT in the movie. 

### Technologies Used
* Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux + Thunk, Axios
* API used: [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* Hosted at Netlify

### Challenges / Lessons Learned
The biggest thing I learned is that if you are making a trivia game app, either write your own API or use a trivia API with questions already built! Don't GET a bunch of raw data and then build your own questions on the fly inside your app components.

### Ideas for improvements
* Hide the "next question" button until the user chooses an answer and the answer has been evaluated.
* Pull the year out of release date and just display that with the movie name.
* Increase the number of movies from which questions are generated.
* Add user accounts so scores can be saved and "high score" can be shown.
